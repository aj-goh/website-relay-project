# Website Relay Project

This is a collaborative coding game inspired by Gartic Phone, where each player takes turns adding to different websites! At the end, we reveal multiple unique websites built by the entire group.

## ðŸ“Œ How the Game Works
1. **Start Multiple Sites**  
Each player starts with a site inside the `websites/` folder:
2. **Take Turns**  
Players get a set amount of time to work on one site, then passes it to the next player.
3. **Build & Rotate**  
Keep adding new features or styling without removing previous work.
4. **Final Reveal**  
Deploy using GitHub Pages and showcase all sites!

## ðŸ”„ Rotation Rules

* Each player works on **one site per round**.
* After your turn, **commit and push** your changes.
* Switch to the next site folder for your next turn.
* **Do NOT delete or overwrite** previous work.

## ðŸŽ² Game Ideas

* Each round, add:

  * A new section (About, Gallery, Contact)
  * A CSS animation or theme
  * A JavaScript feature (button, modal, game)
* Add **hidden easter eggs** for fun!
* Use **comments in code** to show what you added:

  ```html
  <!-- Added navigation bar - John -->
  ```

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure

```
/ (root)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # Main page listing all sites
â”œâ”€â”€ /websites
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ /site1
â”‚     â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚     â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
â”‚     â”‚    â””â”€â”€ script.js
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ /site2
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ /site3
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

We use **GitHub Pages**:

* **Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Source:** `main` branch, `/ (root)` folder.
* Websites will be live at https://aj-goh.github.io/website-relay-project/
